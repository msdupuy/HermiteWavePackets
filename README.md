# HermiteWavePackets.jl

**HermiteWavePackets.jl** is a Julia package designed to handle elementary computations involving Hermite and Gaussian-type functions. The package supports the following classes of functions:

1. **Real Gaussian Polynomials**  
   Functions of the form:
$$P(x) e^{-\frac{a}{2} (x - q)^2},$$  
   where:
   - $a > 0$ is a positive real number,
   - $q \in \\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued shift parameter,
   - \( P(x) \) is a polynomial.

3. **Complex Gaussian Wave Packets**  
   Functions of the form:  
   \[
   P(x) e^{-\frac{z}{2} (x - q)^2} e^{i p x},
   \]  
   where:
   - \( z \in \mathbb{C} \) is a complex parameter (typically with \(\text{Re}(z) > 0\) to ensure decay),
   - \( q, p \in \mathbb{R} \) are real-valued parameters representing spatial shift and momentum, respectively,
   - \( P(x) \) is a polynomial.

The package is designed to provide efficient and accurate tools for computations involving these functions, which appear frequently in quantum mechanics, signal processing, and mathematical analysis.
